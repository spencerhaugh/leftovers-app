# Leftovers!
## Project 4: Software Engineering Immersive 9-21

The rather ambitious plan here was to build a full-stack app using Flask and Vue with a MongoDB database connection. Vue was a brand new technology for me, and I had minimal experience with Flask. Creating a full CRUD, RESTful app, using both my own database API as well as a 3rd party API was a lofty goal.

But, I'm not one to backdown from a challenge.

Leftovers is an app that will connect users to recipes that they can create with the ingredients they have available. When logged in, users can enter an ingredient and are met with receipe options filter by that ingredient. They can then add recepies that interest them to their user account for later reference.
